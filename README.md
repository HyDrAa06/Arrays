# Arrays

## ArrayRotations
### Create a program that receives an array and several rotations that you have to perform. The
### rotations are done by moving the first element of the array from the front to the back. Print the
### resulting array.


## JediAcademy
### Yoda is starting his newly created Jedi academy. So, he asked master John to buy the needed
### equipment. The number of items depends on how many students will sign up. The equipment for
### each Padawan contains:
###  Lightsaber
###  Belt
###  Robe
### You will be given the amount of money John has, the number of students and the prices of each
### item. Calculate if John has enough money to buy equipment for each Padawan or how much more
### money he needs.
### There are some additional requirements:
###  Lightsabres sometimes break, so John should buy 10% more (taken from the students&#39;
### count), rounded up to the next integer.
###  Every sixth belt is free.


## PetersExpenses
### As a MOBA challenger player, Petar has the bad habit of trashing his PC when he loses a game and of
### rage quiting. His gaming setup consists of a headset, mouse, keyboard, and display. You will receive
### Petar&#39;s lost games count.
### Every second lost game, Petar trashes his headset.
### Every third lost game, Petar trashes his mouse.
### When Petar trashes both his mouse and headset in the same lost game, he also trashes his
### keyboard.
### Every second time, when he trashes his keyboard, he also trashes his display.
### You will receive the price of each item in his gaming setup. Calculate his rage expenses for renewing
### his gaming equipment.


## CoffeeOrders
### We are placing N orders at a time. You need to calculate the price with the following formula:

### ((daysInMonth * capsulesCount) * pricePerCapsule)

###  On the first line, you will receive integer N – the count of orders the shop will receive.
###  For each order you will receive the following information:
### o Price per capsule – floating-point number in the range [0.00…1000.00].
### o Days – integer in the range [1…31].
### o Capsules count – integer in the range [0…2000].


## EqualElementsInArray
### Create a program that determines if an element exists in an array for which the sum of all elements
### to its left is equal to the sum of all elements to its right. If there are no elements to the left or right,
### their sum is considered to be 0. Print the index of the element that satisfies the condition or &quot;no&quot; if
### there is no such element.


## LongestSequenceOfEqualElements
### Create a program that finds the longest sequence of equal elements in an array of integers. If
### several equal sequences are present in the array, print out the leftmost one.


## UniquePairs
### Create a program, which prints all unique pairs in an array of integers whose sum is equal to a given
### number.


## Ladybugs
### You are given a field size and the indexes where ladybugs can be found on the field. On every new
### line, until the &quot;end&quot; command is given, a ladybug changes its position either to its left or to its right

### by a given fly length. A movement description command looks like this: &quot;0 right 1&quot;. This means
### that the little insect placed on index 0 should fly one index to its right. If the ladybug lands on
### another ladybug, it continues to fly in the same direction repeating the specified flight length. If the
### ladybug flies out of the field, it is gone.
### For example, you are given a field of size 3, where there are ladybugs on indexes 0 and 1. If the
### ladybug on index 0 needs to fly to its right by the length of 1 (0 right 1), it will attempt to land on
### index 1 but as there is another ladybug there, it will continue further to the right passing 1 index in
### , landing on index 2. After that, if the same ladybug needs to fly to its right passing 1 index (2
### right 1), it will land somewhere outside of the field, so it flies away.
### ### If we receive an initial index that does not contain a ladybug, nothing happens. If you are given a
### ladybug index that is outside the field, nothing happens. In the end, print all cells of the field
### separated by blank spaces. For each cell that has a ladybug in it print;1; and for each empty cell print
### ;0;. The output of the example above should be &quot;0 1 0;.
